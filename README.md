# Introduction
The problem statement of the project is to develop a **FAKE NEWS DETECTION SYSTEM** using natural language processing and 
Passive Aggressive Classifier, and its accuracy is tested using different machine learning algorithms (_94.16%_) . Detection of false news articles will solve obstacles, the chaos created by fake news. The project uses different widely used machine learning methods (_Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Passive Aggressive Classifier_) and give a response telling the user about the credibility of that news.

# Dataset
 Dataset was taken from kaggle competition - [Fake News](https://www.kaggle.com/c/fake-news/data)
This dataset has a shape of 20800Ã—5. 
train.csv: A full training dataset with the following   attributes:
* id: unique id for a news article
* title: the title of a news article
* author: author of the news article
* text: the text of the article; could be incomplete
* label: a label that marks the article as potentially unreliable:
    1. 1: unreliable
    2. 0: reliable

# Getting started

#### For installation of the required libraries 
```
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
#### Create the machine learning model
```
python3 fake1.py
```
#### Start the FLask API
```
python3 app1.py
```
#### Navigate to the URL 
By default, flask will run on port 5000.
